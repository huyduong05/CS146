The same approach is used for both Java and Python.

Iniution: 
    The problem is essentially asking us to make a minimum spanning tree and to add up all the edge weights (the costs of the pipes) to get the minimum total cost to supply water to all houses.

Procedure: 
1. Utilize Kruskal's Algorithm and Union Find to create a minimum spanning tree
2. Add up all edges in the MST and return the result
