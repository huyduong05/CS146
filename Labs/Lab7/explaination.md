The same approach is used for Java and Python.

Initution: 
    The problem is needs us find cities that connect with each other with the threshold distance. So we would have to find the shortest paths that connect each city to each other. For each city, we need to find what and how many other cities connect to that city. From this we can find what city has the least amount of neighbors

Procedure:
    For this problem we can use Floyd Marshall Algorithm to get the shortest path that connectes each city. 
    With Floyd Marshalls, we have to make sure that the shortest paths have to follow the threshold. 
    After running Floyd Marshalls with the modification, then return the city with the least amount of connecting cities.
